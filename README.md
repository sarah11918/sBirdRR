## sBird - React Router project

This is an app that pulls data from eBird.org to display recent/notable bird sightings reported by the community.

I initially built this so that I could monitor the status of my Rare/Unusual bird sightings, because one's own account page doesn't show the verified/not-yet-verified status of your observations, even though that information is available via the eBird API. I added some options to display various other bird observation data, such as the most recent bird reported in an area, and a list of all species of birds EVER reported in an area.

I was learning to use React Router for page navigation, hence sBirdRR.
